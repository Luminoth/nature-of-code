# The Ecosystem Project

* Imagine a population of computational creatures swimming around a digital pond, interacting with each other according to various rules.

## Step 1: Rules

* Nervous Fly
* Swimming Fish
* Slithering Snake

## TODO:

* Creatures should only face the direction they're accelerating themselves, not the direction of their velocity
* Allow snakes to cross into the water section
* Wind (show force in UI)
* Water flow (show force in UI)
* Add glowing fly with particle system trails
* Creature health - diminish over time, use mouse to drop "food" they can use to replish
  * Use an attractor on the food, but keep creatures repelling each other
  * Render health as a rect on top of creatures
  * Creatures that have 0 health die and despawn
